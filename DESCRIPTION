Description:
    XAItest is an R Package that identifies features using eXplainable AI (XAI)
    methods such as SHAP or LIME. This package allows users to compare
    these methods with traditional statistical tests like t-tests, empirical
    Bayes, and Fisher's test. Additionally, it includes a system that enables
    the comparison of feature importance with p-values by incorporating
    calibrated simulated data.
